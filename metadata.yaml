description: In 1741, the HMS Wager wrecked in an uninhabited area off the coast of
  Chile. In the aftermath of the disaster, chaos took hold. One faction of the surviving
  crew rose up against the officers of the ship and attempted to make their way to
  a Chilean city in a rickety boat. In this volume, Royal Navy officer John Byron
  presents his version of the mutiny.
